# Minor Project 2
This is our Minor project 2 for the 6th semester of B.Tech CSE CCVT batch of 2019-2023. We are working on a Comparitive Analysis of Scheduling Algorithms. We have created a Java Swing application which functions all the below mentioned algorithms. One can add processes and output gets displayed along with the Gantt chart.
## Algorithms used:
- Shortest Job First Algorithm
- First Come First Serve Algorithm
- Shortest Remaining Time First Algorithm
- Priority Preemptive Algorithm
- Priority Non-Preemptive Algorithm
- Round-Robin Algorithm
## Languages and Technology used:
- Java
- Java AWT
- Swing Framework
- XML
## IDE and Version Control: 
VScode, Apache NetBeans, and Git respectively.
